# Welcome to my APOD NASA free API repository!

## Short summary

This is a project where I use API to get data using Javascript.
I used the APOD API which can be found [here](https://api.nasa.gov/).
If you don't find it just search for APOD.

## What the page knows

Page shows the information of the actual day APOD shows.
Basically an image with it's title and description.

If you would like to search information of a different day there is a possibility to add it into the header input field.

If you want to check the page please click on the following [link](https://buczkobalazs.github.io/NASA-APOD-open-api/).

## What needs to be done

I have some plans how to improve the page in the upcoming weeks.
The following list should be done:

- Style it with css not to look so odd
- Separate today's information from the section where you can choose your preferred date
- Create a so-called 'Gallery' section where you can swipe through random images provided by the API
